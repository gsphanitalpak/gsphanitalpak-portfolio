    content: `# Setting Up a Headless Raspberry Pi with TigerVNC for Remote Access
If you're someone who loves working on Raspberry Pi projects but doesn't want to keep a monitor and keyboard attached, that defeats the portability of the Pi, then setting up your Raspberry Pi in "headless" mode is the way to go. In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up your Raspberry Pi without a monitor and configuring TigerVNC for remote access. This allows you to access the Raspberry Pi's desktop environment from any device on the same network.

## Why Headless?

A **headless** Raspberry Pi setup means you're running the Raspberry Pi without a monitor, mouse, or keyboard. This is incredibly useful for projects where you don't need to interact with the Pi directly, such as when it's used as a server or IoT device. Plus, it helps reduce clutter and makes your setup more portable.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- A Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 4, 3, or Zero. Any suitable Pi model with Wi-Fi works.).

- MicroSD card (8GB or more) with a compatible adapter or reader for PC/laptop connectivity.

- Power supply for the Raspberry Pi.
- A device (PC or Mac) to access the Raspberry Pi remotely.

## Step 1: Preparing the Raspberry Pi MicroSD Card

1. **Download Raspberry Pi Imager**: Head to the official Raspberry Pi website and install it on your computer. Launch the Imager.

2. **Select the correct board**
> Tip: If you are not sure of the board model, check on the Pi board â€” it should be printed as shown).

3. **Enable SSH for Remote Access by OS Customisation**
To set up your Pi headless, you'll need SSH (Secure Shell) access. After selecting the correct board and filling up the OS Customisation, make a note of the following:
- **Hostname** assigned to the Pi *(required for IP of the Pi if you are working with multiple devices connected to the network)*
- **Username and Password** *(These are required for authentication to access the remote SSH)*

- **Enable SSH**: In the Services tab, toggle the **Enable SSH** with password authentication. *(Password authentication is recommended instead of public-key authentication for beginners.)*

4. Leave the Options tab as default and click **SAVE**. The OS Customisation menu will close.

5. Then select the storage device *(microSD card â€” this is also called the Boot media).*
> **NOTE:** The boot media will be formatted and then the OS will be etched onto it.

6. The final step of setting up the boot media is to click **WRITE** and wait for the process to be completed.

## Step 2: Booting the Raspberry Pi

- Remove the power cord from the Pi *(if connected).*
> **NOTE:** Always make connections to the Pi only when it's not connected to any power.

- Insert the MicroSD card into the Pi and power it ON.

## ðŸ”“ Step 3: Enabling VNC

After successful booting of the Pi:

- You can check this with the LED indicators on the Pi:
  - Power LED labelled as **PWR LED**: Solid red
  - Activity LED labelled as **ACT LED**: Blinking green

1. Open Terminal (on macOS) or Command Prompt (on Windows).
  > TIP: Open Command Prompt as an administrator for smooth execution.

2. Run:
\`\`\`bash
ping -4 <pi-local-hostname>
\`\`\`

Example:
\`\`\`bash
ping -4 pi
\`\`\`

This returns the IP address of the Pi.
*Let's say it returned \`192.168.2.1\`*

3. Type the following command and hit the <kbd>Return/Enter</kbd> Key:
\`\`\`bash
ssh <username>@<ip-address>
\`\`\`

Example:
\`\`\`bash
ssh pi-001@192.168.2.1
\`\`\`

4. This prompts for a password *(this is the password set in the General tab of OS Customisations).*

5. You will now see the Pi terminal *(the prompt changes from your local machine to the Pi)*:
\`\`\`bash
pi-001@raspberrypi$
\`\`\`

6. Run:
\`\`\`bash
sudo raspi-config
\`\`\`

7. Navigate to **Interfaces** using the down arrow, then hit **Enter**.

8. Inside Interfaces, look for **VNC** and enable it with Enter.

9. To return back, use **Tab** to go to the **Finish** button and hit **Enter**.

Now the Pi is ready to be connected to a VNC viewer.

## Step 4: Connecting VNC Viewer (TigerVNC)

1. Download any VNC viewer on your system *(here we're using TigerVNC viewer).*
> To download, head to your browser and search *"VNC viewer download"* and choose any VNC Viewer application.

2. Launch the application.

3. You will be asked to enter the IP address.
> If you haven't noted it down, you can use:
\`\`\`bash
ping -4 <pi-local-hostname>
\`\`\`

to get the IP address of the Pi.

4. Enter the IP in the VNC viewer application. It will prompt you for the **username** and **password**
*(these are the same as the ones set in the General tab of OS Customisations).*

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
Now you will be able to see the Pi desktop on your local machine. You can run commands, start to tinker, and learn more.`,
